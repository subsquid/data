# 02 — Data model

This document defines the abstract state on which all other documents operate. Nothing here
prescribes a storage layout; it prescribes what must be *representable* and what the
observable structure of the data is.

## 1. Primitive types

**DEF-1 (Block number).** A natural number `n ∈ ℕ`, strictly increasing along a chain. It does
**not** necessarily increase by exactly 1: Solana numbers blocks by time-based **slots**, and a
slot that produced no block leaves a hole. Numbering therefore carries no structural guarantee —
`parent_number` (DEF-4) does.

**DEF-2 (Hash).** An opaque, non-empty string. Hashes are compared by exact string
equality; the service assigns no meaning to their content. All sources of a dataset MUST
use one consistent representation (a representation mismatch between sources is a source
fault, [FM-SRC-7](08-failure-model.md)).

**DEF-3 (Block reference / Ref).** A pair `⟨number, hash⟩` identifying one block.

**DEF-4 (Block).** A tuple:

```
Block = ⟨ number : ℕ,
          hash : Hash,
          parent_number : ℕ,          — the number of the parent block
          parent_hash : Hash,
          payload : Payload(kind),
          time : Timestamp | ⊥ ⟩
```

`parent_number = number − 1` on a densely-numbered chain (evm, hyperliquid); on a slot-numbered
one (Solana) it may sit further down. Always `parent_number < number`; a block violating this
is structurally invalid ([WP-2](03-write-path.md)). `⟨parent_number, parent_hash⟩` is what makes
a run of blocks a chain — the numbering alone does not (DEF-1).

`time` is informational; no correctness property depends on it (clock-free correctness,
[CN-8](05-consistency-and-durability.md)).

**DEF-5 (Kind and payload schema).** Every dataset has an immutable **kind** — a chain
family identifier (e.g. `evm`, `solana`, `bitcoin`, `tron`, `hyperliquid-fills`,
`hyperliquid-replica-cmds`). A kind defines:

- the **header** attributes of a block;
- a fixed set of named **item collections** (e.g. transactions, logs, traces, state diffs,
  instructions), where each **item** is a record carrying (at least) the number of the
  block it belongs to, plus kind-specific attributes;
- the **query dialect**: which filter predicates and field selections are expressible;
- optional **availability**: an item collection MAY be absent for sub-ranges of the chain
  (the source did not provide it). Availability is a property of stored data and is
  reported per query ([RP-8](04-read-path.md)).

The internal encoding of payloads is out of scope; §6 of [12-conformance-tdd.md](12-conformance-tdd.md)
defines the kind-agnostic structural checks a harness can still perform.

## 2. Dataset state

**DEF-6 (Dataset).** A dataset `D` is the tuple:

```
D = ⟨ kind    : Kind,                      — immutable after creation
      seg     : ⟨b_1 … b_n⟩, n ≥ 0,        — the stored chain segment (window)
      anchor  : ⟨number : ℕ ∪ {−1}, hash : Hash | ⊥⟩,  — a position below seg (DEF-7)
      fin     : Ref | ⊥,                   — finalized watermark
      ret     : RetentionPolicy,
      ver     : ℕ ⟩                        — commit version, increments on every transition
```

Derived values (defined when `seg` is non-empty):

```
first(D) = b_1.number          head(D) = ⟨b_n.number, b_n.hash⟩
next(D)  = head(D).number + 1  (if seg empty: anchor.number + 1)
span(D)  = n                   (window size in blocks)
```

A dataset state is **well-formed** iff it satisfies the structural invariants
INV-1 … INV-7 of [06-invariants.md](06-invariants.md). Every externally observable state
MUST be well-formed.

**DEF-7 (Anchor).** `anchor` names a position below `first(D)` — on a densely-numbered
chain exactly `first(D) − 1`; on a slot-numbered chain possibly lower (a RETAIN may land
on a hole, and the next stored block may sit above it — INV-3). When its hash is
known, it carries `hash_at(anchor.number)` (DEF-16): on a densely-numbered chain the hash of
the block at that position; on a slot-numbered chain the hash of the nearest block at or
below it (the position itself may be a hole). The anchor is how a window "remembers" its
connection to the chain below the window. `anchor.hash = ⊥` is permitted (e.g. a window
starting at genesis — `anchor = ⟨−1, ⊥⟩` — or an operator-supplied start without a hash);
when it is `⊥`, linkage of `b_1` cannot be verified and is accepted as-is.

**DEF-16 (Preceding block; chain hash at a position).** The **preceding block** of a
position `n` is the highest stored block numbered below `n` — the block anything starting
at `n` must link to. Its hash is `hash_at(n − 1)`:

```
hash_at(p) = hash of the highest stored block with number ≤ p,
             or anchor.hash when no stored block lies at or below p and p ≥ anchor.number;
             undefined below the anchor
```

On a densely-numbered chain the preceding block of `n` is simply block `n − 1`; on a
slot-numbered chain it is the nearest block below `n`, wherever it sits. Everywhere the
protocol anchors a client or a source to a position — the anchor (DEF-7),
`expected_parent` (DEF-13), fork-signal hints (DEF-12), CONFLICT hints
([RP-11](04-read-path.md)), continuation cursors ([RP-10](04-read-path.md)) — a pair
`⟨p, h⟩` reads "`h` is the hash of the preceding block of `p + 1`" (`h = hash_at(p)`),
**not** "a block numbered `p` has hash `h`". The two readings coincide exactly on
densely-numbered chains.

**DEF-8 (Finalized watermark).** `fin`, when defined, designates a stored block
(`first ≤ fin.number ≤ head.number`, hash matching the stored block — INV-5/6) that the
sources have declared irreversible. Blocks at or below `fin.number` form the **finalized
prefix**; blocks above it are the **volatile suffix**, subject to replacement by forks.

**DEF-9 (Retention policy).** One of:

| Policy | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Window(k)` | Keep (at least) all stored blocks in the last `k` **positions** below `next(D)`; trim the rest as the head advances. `k` counts numbers, not stored blocks: on a slot-numbered chain the window holds ≤ `k` blocks. `k ≥ 1`. |
| `Pinned(from, hash?)` | Keep everything from block `from` upward; `hash?` optionally asserts the anchor at `from − 1`. |
| `External` | The lower bound is set at runtime by the retention controller via the SET-RETENTION operation. Until first set: unbounded, and a dataset that is *empty* at activation defers ingestion until the first instruction (WP-5). |
| `Unbounded` | Never trim. |

**DEF-10 (Version order).** For one dataset, committed states are totally ordered by
`ver`. "Later state" always means greater `ver`, never a comparison of head numbers (a
fork can lower the head number while increasing `ver`).

## 3. Snapshots

**DEF-11 (Snapshot).** An immutable, well-formed dataset state as of some committed
version. Every read operation is evaluated against exactly one snapshot
([INV-20](06-invariants.md)). Snapshots of different datasets are independent; no
operation observes a cross-dataset "consistent cut", and none is guaranteed to exist.

## 4. Source-facing events

Ingestion consumes an abstract event stream per dataset (how it is transported is a
binding concern):

**DEF-12 (Source events).**

| Event | Content | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Blocks(⟨b…⟩)` | contiguous, internally linked run of blocks | candidate extension of the chain at the position the service requested |
| `ForkSignal(hints)` | non-empty ascending list of `⟨position, hash⟩` pairs, read per DEF-16 (a hint at a stored position of the source's chain is a true block ref; at a hole it carries the preceding block's hash) | the source disagrees with the service's requested position; `hints` name recent positions of the source's canonical chain near the divergence point |
| `FinalitySignal(ref)` | a Ref | the source declares `ref` (and everything below it on its chain) final |
| `OnTip` | — | the source believes the service has caught up with its tip |

Delivery is at-least-once, per source; ordering is guaranteed only within one source's
stream between reconnects. Multiple sources are reconciled by arbitration
([WP-4](03-write-path.md)).

## 5. Query-facing objects

**DEF-13 (Query).** A read request:

```
Query = ⟨ dialect         : Kind,               — must match the dataset kind
          from            : ℕ,                  — inclusive lower bound
          to              : ℕ | ⊥,              — inclusive upper bound; ⊥ = open-ended
          expected_parent : Hash | ⊥,           — asserted hash of from's preceding block (DEF-16)
          finalized_only  : bool,               — restrict to the finalized prefix
          selection       : kind-specific filters (item requests) and field projections,
          include_all     : bool ⟩              — emit headers even for blocks with no matches
```

**DEF-14 (Coverage).** The result of a successful query is defined by its **coverage**:
a contiguous range `[from, L]` of block numbers, `L ≥ from`, fully processed against the
query's snapshot. The response *emits* the subset of covered blocks required by
`selection`/`include_all`; coverage — not emission — is what the client uses to make
progress ([RP-9](04-read-path.md)).

**DEF-15 (Watermark reads).** Point reads returning the current committed `head`, `fin`,
retention policy, and dataset status. Defined in [04-read-path.md §6](04-read-path.md).

## 6. Transitions (summary)

The complete write-side vocabulary; semantics in [03-write-path.md](03-write-path.md):

| Transition | Effect on ⟨seg, anchor, fin⟩ |
|---|---|
| `CREATE(kind, ret)` | new empty dataset with an initial anchor per policy |
| `EXTEND(B, f?)` | append blocks at the tail; optionally advance `fin` |
| `REPLACE(from, B, f?)` | fork: atomically substitute the suffix `≥ from` with `B` |
| `FINALIZE(r)` | advance `fin` (monotone, clamped to the stored chain) |
| `RETAIN(from, h?)` | trim the prefix `< from`; move the anchor up |
| `RESET(a)` | clear the segment, re-anchor at `a` (self-healing / re-targeting) |
| `DROP` | remove the dataset and all its data |

Each transition is atomic and increments `ver` exactly once — except CREATE, which
*establishes* `ver = 0`: it starts the version sequence rather than extending one. A
single commit MAY compose `EXTEND`/`REPLACE` with `FINALIZE` (blocks and a finality
advance arriving together); invariants are evaluated at commit points only.

## 7. Terminology cross-reference

| Term used elsewhere | Defined as |
|---|---|
| window | `seg` (DEF-6) |
| head / first block | derived values of DEF-6 |
| finalized prefix / volatile suffix | DEF-8 |
| anchor | DEF-7 |
| preceding block / `hash_at(p)` | DEF-16 |
| coverage | DEF-14 |
| fork hints | `ForkSignal.hints` (DEF-12), also the payload of the CONFLICT error (RP-11) |
| batch | the unit of one `EXTEND`/`REPLACE` commit (bounded by P-BATCH-ROWS / P-BATCH-BYTES) |
